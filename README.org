* My emacs configuration

This is an emacs configuration heavily inspired by spacemacs and
Harry Schwartz's config.

There's some boilerplate setup code in init.el, everything else
is configured in config.org and loaded through org-babel.

** Usage

If you don't already have an emacs configuration locally you can
just clone this right into your home directory. You don't even
need to provide a path since this repository is called .emacs.d! :)

This configuration is set up so that use-package installs itself on
first run and then loads in all the other packages. This means that
cloning this repository and then opening emacs will install everything
that's needed for the config to work automagically.
